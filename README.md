I chose an article by Don Norman called, "I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me.". 

On the basis of the Figma design, I developed a website displaying the article snippet and my reflection in html and CSS. 

I will demonstrate how I chose the design, why I chose his article, how I reflected on it, what my challenges are, and what my next steps are.
