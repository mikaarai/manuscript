						<p>More people than ever are living long, healthy lives. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the average life expectancy is 78.6 years for men and 81.1 for women. More relevant, however, is that as people grow older, their total life expectancy increases. So for those who are now 65, the average life expectancy is 83 for men and over 85 for women. And because I’m 83, I’m expected to live past 90 (but I’m aiming a lot higher than that). And these are averages, which means that perhaps half of us will live even longer. </p>
						<p>Those of us who are still active and healthy at advanced ages–I qualify–discover that we aren’t quite as capable as our younger selves. That doesn’t mean that we aren’t healthy and workable–I still have a very active job and travel on business around the world, but I have to admit that I’m getting slower and weaker, with diminished eyesight, hearing, taste, touch, and, well, almost everything physical. The number of active, healthy oldsters is large–and increasing. We are not a niche market. And businesses should take note: We are good customers often with more free time and discretionary income than younger people.</p>
						<blockquote><em>"Despite our increasing numbers the world seems to be designed against the elderly. Everyday household goods require knives and pliers to open. Containers with screw tops require more strength than my wife or I can muster. (We solve this by using a plumber’s wrench to turn the caps.)"</em></blockquote> 
						<p>Companies insist on printing critical instructions in tiny fonts with very low contrast. Labels cannot be read without flashlights and magnifying lenses. And when companies do design things specifically for the elderly, they tend to be ugly devices that shout out to the world “I’m old and can’t function!” We can do better.</p>

						<h2>Older consumers want and need</h2>
						<p> We age, we have more experience with life, which can make us better decision-makers and managers. Crystalized intelligence, it is called, and it gets better with experience. A caveat is that we often face physical changes that designers fail to account for into their work.</p>
						<p>Vision deteriorates. The lens of our eyes harden, making focusing more difficult. I used to be able to read tiny text by holding it close to my eyes, but my inability to focus at close distances defeats that activity. Floaters and debris start accumulating inside the eye, which scatters the light on its way to the retina, reducing contrast and making it more difficult to see small, low-contrast objects. For the increasing number of people who have cataract surgery, the eye’s lenses have ben replaced with plastic, which usually have a fixed focus. (Artificial lenses that can be focused are under development.) A flashlight has become an essential item, whether the one built into many phones or carried separately, because illumination makes tiny type easier to read although even then, a magnifying glass might be useful.</p>
						<p>Hearing decreases. High frequencies are first to go, which also tends to impair directional sensitivity, which in turn makes it more difficult to attend to someone in a crowded, noisy environment. Loud restaurants are torture. So, more and more, my wife and I select restaurants by their noise level rather than by their food quality. At home while watching TV, whether shows, streaming events, or movies, we always turn on the captions, which often block critical parts of the image. Even worse, when a film shows someone speaking in a foreign language, the film often translates the words, but so too does the closed captioning, and the two are placed on top of one another, making both attempts to help the viewer completely unhelpful.</p>

						<h2>Bad design abounds</h2>
						<p>The problems I face are much milder than those faced by millions of aging people. With so many of us needing better devices, why are so many things still designed in ways that defeat our ability to function?</p>
						<p>Take the screen design for Apple’s phones. The designers at Apple apparently believe that text is ugly, so it should either be eliminated entirely or made as invisible as possible. Bruce Tognazzini and I, both former employees of Apple, wrote a long article on Apple’s usability sins ,which has been read by hundreds of thousands of people. Once Apple products could be used without ever reading a manual. Today, Apple’s products violate all the fundamental rules of design for understanding and usability, many of which Tognazzini and I had helped develop. As a result, even a manual is not enough: all the arbitrary gestures that control tablets, phones, and computers have to be memorized. Everything has to be memorized.</p>
						<p>These thoughtless, inappropriate designs are not limited to Apple. New technologies tend to rely on display screens, often with tiny lettering, with touch-sensitive areas that are exceedingly difficult to hit as eye-hand coordination declines. Physical controls are by far the easiest to control–safer too, especially in safety-critical tasks such as driving a car, but they are disappearing. Why? To save a few cents in manufacturing and in a misplaced desire to be trendy. Speech can be a useful substitute for physical controls, though not as helpful as proponents claim.</p>
						<p>Then there’s the aesthetic problem. When products are developed for the elderly, they tend to be ugly and an unwanted signal of fragility. As a result, people who need walkers or canes often resist. Once upon a time, a cane was stylish: Today it is seen as a medical device. Why can’t we have walkers and canes for everyday use, to help us in everyday life, to carry our packages, provide a way to sit when we are tired, or viewing some event, and yes, to maintain our balance? Make them items of pride, stylish enough that everyone will want one.</p>

						<h2>Everyone needs better design</h2>
						<p>Do not think that thoughtful design is just for the elderly, or the sick, or the disabled. In the field of design, this is called “inclusive design” for a reason: It helps everyone. Curb cuts were meant to help people who had trouble walking, but it helps anyone wheeling things: carts, baby carriages, suitcases. Closed captions are used in noisy bars. As Kat Holmes points out in her book Mismatch, all of us are disabled now and then. Some of us have permanent disabilities, but all of us have suffered from situational and temporary problems. </p>
						<p>When outside in the sun, the text message that just arrived is unreadable: wouldn’t it be nice if the display, whether cellphone, watch, or tablet, could switch to large, higher contrast lettering? Are elderly people handicapped? Maybe, but so is a young, athletic parent while carrying a baby on one arm and a bag of groceries in the other (and perhaps trying to open their car door). Ride-share bicycles and scooters cannot be used by people who need to carry bulky packages. Everyone has difficulty hearing people in noisy environments. Noise-canceling headphones are for everyone, not just the elderly. Almost anything that will help the elderly population will end up helping everyone.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>by Mika Arai</p>
						<p>I chose this book because I was intrigued by a title written by Don Norman <cite>'I wrote a book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me: The world is designed against the elderly'.</cite> I consider Don Norman a leading figure in UX. I’ve read his well-known book The Design of Everyday Things and attended some of his recent talks organized by ADP List. I was curious to see what insights he would share in this article. This reflection captures my thoughts as I read it.</p>
						<p>It broke my heart when Don, 83 years old, said: <em>“Despite our increasing numbers the world seems to be designed against the elderly“. </em> In my design process, I have always considered future generations or young people, but have never taken into account the crowds around old age. It makes me feel bad knowing that my parents or older generation may have trouble utilizing technology. When I was designing a donation app, I haven't thought about testing/interviewing people with old age, as older people are generally more generous and have lots of philanthropists who are willing to donate to charities. </p>
						<p>I agree with the following statement: <em>“Companies insist on printing critical instructions in tiny fonts with very low contrast. Labels cannot be read without flashlights and magnifying lenses. And when companies do design things specifically for the elderly, they tend to be ugly devices that shout out to the world “I’m old and can’t function!”.</em> Whether it is in an article, instructions, or a picture, I find many texts very small. I often find myself zooming in by spreading my fingers on the screen or squinting my eyes because of my poor eyesight. I appreciate products like Kindle, which lets you setup the font size, so you don't have to constantly zoom in. </p>
						<p>With respect to accessibility or inclusive design, I believe things are improving, especially for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. This is one of the areas I want to focus on in my grad school studies, as I have a family member with disabilities, and communication was always a significant challenge. This was an opportunity for me to explore different ways to communicate through technology and simplify people's lives. </p>
						<blockquote><em>“Vision deteriorates. The lens of our eyes harden, making focusing more difficult. Hearing decreases. High frequencies are first to go, which also tends to impair directional sensitivity, which in turn makes it more difficult to attend to someone in a crowded, noisy environment.”.</em></blockquote> 
						<p>This phrase really makes me sad, even brings a tear to my eye. It reminds me of my father when his health deteriorated slowly. I believe that someone who has developed an app may not fully understand this issue unless they have personally experienced it or been around someone who has, so I appreciate that Don shared his personal experience. Accessibility features often aren't implemented unless required by law or considered absolutely necessary, as they can be time-consuming and costly. I've suggested accessibility improvements to my employer in the past, but my suggestions were dismissed.</p>
						<p>I agree with Don when he said accessibility isn't just for the elderly or people with disabilities, but for anyone. Noise cancellation is incredibly useful not only for individuals with hearing impairments but also for anyone using it during Zoom meetings. Voice commands aren’t just beneficial for those with neurological disorders, they’re also helpful for parents juggling a child in one arm and groceries in the other. I believe that accessibility is a necessity and an urgent matter. The article is well written, and I think everyone should read it.</p> 
						<p>My favorite thing about Don's story was that he shared his daily life struggles and experiences. I gained a better understanding of how the elderly see the world. It was eye-opening and I will continue to advocate for accessibility.</p>
